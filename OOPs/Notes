Abstraction means hiding internal details and showing only required features.
Encapsulation means Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.

Inheritance When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance.
It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

So inheritance means specialization and polymorphism means generalization.

For every class Java will create a separate class file, .class file.

If you want to print the object itself,     then the object should have toString method implemented.
